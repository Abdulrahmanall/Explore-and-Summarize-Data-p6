# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : wineQualityReds

### Project Overview
In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### Introduction
For the final project, you will conduct your own exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of your choice.

The analysis should be almost like a stream-of-consciousness as you ask questions, create visualizations, and explore your data.

### What are include ?
- The **RMD** file containing the analysis (final plots and summary, and reflection).
- The **HTML** file knitted from the RMD file using the knitr package.
- The **original** data set.
